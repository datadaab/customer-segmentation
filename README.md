# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Click here to view my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/datadaab/customer-segmentation/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb).

## Overview

This project focuses on the targeted use of k-means clustering to segment approximately 2000 customer IDs from a wholesale market campaign. By applying this machine learning technique, the project successfully identifies three homogeneous customer groups. These segments provide a foundation for developing specific marketing strategies tailored to each group's unique characteristics and needs.

## Key Areas Impacted by Customer Segmentation

- **Marketing Strategy Optimization**: Segmentation enables precise marketing strategies. By understanding the unique characteristics of each segment, businesses can tailor their approaches to effectively target each group, enhancing the efficiency and impact of marketing campaigns.

- **Tailored Messaging**: Customer segmentation facilitates highly personalized communication. Specific insights about each group allow for the development of customized messages that resonate more deeply with the intended audience, improving engagement and response rates.
